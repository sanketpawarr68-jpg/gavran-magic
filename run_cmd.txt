# Gavran Magic Website - Run Instructions

Follow these steps to run the project locally. You will need two separate terminal windows.

### 1. Backend (Flask API)
This handles the database and API logic.

Open Terminal 1:
```bash
cd backend

# Install dependencies (if not already installed)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the server
python app.py
```
> The backend will run on: **http://localhost:5000**


### 2. Frontend (React App)
This handles the user interface.

Open Terminal 2:
```bash
cd frontend-react

# Install dependencies (only needed first time)
npm install

# Run the development server
npm run dev
```
> The frontend will run on: **http://localhost:5173** (or similar port)


### 3. Additional Notes
- **Config**: API URL is configured in `frontend-react/src/config.js`.
- **Deployment**: See `DEPLOY_TO_NETLIFY.md` for deployment instructions.
